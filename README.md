# CyberSecurity

Welcome to my CyberSecurity repository!  
This repo is a collection of notes, exercises, and mini projects as I learn cybersecurity concepts through practical and theoretical study.

This project covers:
- Cybersecurity fundamentals  
- Networking basics (OSI Model, TCP/IP, Firewalls, etc.)  
- Common attacks (Phishing, DoS, Malware, etc.)  
- Security frameworks and compliance (ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR)  
- Tools like Wireshark, SIEM, and Splunk

  Learning Goals
- Build a strong foundation in cybersecurity  
- Document my progress from beginner to expert  
- Share study notes and mini projects with others
